Adobe Swatch Exchange file to Mac OS X CLR

This is a simple tool that reads a Adobe Swatch Excahnge (ASE) file and outputs a .clr file that you can 
copy to your ~/Library/Colors directory and use from the standard color picker.

* Supports RGB/CMYK and Gray colorspaces (Lab values will show black).
* Right now it ignores groups in the ASE file.
