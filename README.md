# Ase2clr & Html2Clr

Adobe Swatch Exchange and HTML hex list import to Mac OS X CLR (ColorPicker)

## ase2clr

This is a simple tool that reads a Adobe Swatch Excahnge (ASE) file and outputs a .clr file that you can 
copy to your ~/Library/Colors directory and use from the standard color picker.

* Supports RGB/CMYK and Gray colorspaces (Lab values will show black).
* Right now it ignores groups in the ASE file.

## Html2Clr

This tool reads a file containing a list of hex-coded colors and outputs a .clr file for ColorPicker or installs the list in the system color picker as a new palette.
